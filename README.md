The image above showcases Eclipse Engine being used in a demo scene (available in the examples directory).

Eclipse Engine is a 2D, Cross-Platform, Pygame-OpenGL based Game Engine, that makes creating games in python easy. Previously to Eclipse, you would have to manually render each sprite, and create all the normal systems a game engine might have by yourself! Eclipse makes it super simple to create collisions, trigger events, sprites, animations, text and more!
